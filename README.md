# Persona Lab starter

An intentionally low-fidelity, connected paper prototype for the Codex Masterclass exercise.

For the participant workflow and copyable prompts, see [WORKSHOP-GUIDE.md](./WORKSHOP-GUIDE.md).

Participants turn three connected paper sketches (Landing, Workspace, and Results) into a website using the supplied fictional assets and copy.

## Preview in your Codex sandbox

Ask Codex to start a preview in your sandbox and return a browser-accessible URL. The repository's [agent guidance](AGENTS.md) describes the workshop VM preview setup.

```text
Start a preview of this Persona Lab starter in my sandbox. Follow the
repository's preview instructions and give me a browser-accessible URL.
```

## Prepared paper prototype and asset pack

The preview opens the paper mock at `/`. You can also visit
`/workshop/mock/index.html` for the connected
pencil-sketch mock, `/workshop/index.html` for the supplied brand logo,
characters, client stories, and supporter logos, and
`/workshop/instructions.html` for the workshop prompts.

See [the asset map](public/workshop/ASSETS.md). No participant uploads or
image generation are required. The paper prototype is a design reference,
not a finished website. There is no separate application mock.

## GitHub Pages deployment

After this setup is merged into `main`, the paper mock will be published at
[https://kaihaohust.github.io/persona-lab/](https://kaihaohust.github.io/persona-lab/).
Every push to `main` runs the GitHub Pages workflow: `npm ci`, `npm test`,
`npm run build`, then deployment of `dist/`. Pull requests run the same tests
and build without deploying. Deployment status is available in the repository's
Actions tab; Pages uses **GitHub Actions** as its publishing source.

Production assets use the `/persona-lab/` base path. To check the production
build locally, run `npm ci`, `npm run build`, then
`npx vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3003 --strictPort` and open
`http://localhost:3003/persona-lab/` (use an available port in 3000–3999 on the
workshop VM). The development preview still opens at `/`.

## Exercise boundaries

- This app has no real browser or model integration.
- The sample journey and rationale are simulated; they are not human research.
